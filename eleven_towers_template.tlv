   / /------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
   / | The Second Annual Makerchip ASIC Design Showdown, Summer 2026, Eleven Towers |
   / \------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
   /
   / Find details in the repository README.md, and
   / register at https://www.redwoodeda.com/showdown-info.
   /
   / Each player modifies this template to provide their own custom player
   / control circuitry. This template is for players using TL-Verilog. A Verilog-based
   / template is provided separately. Monitor the Showdown Slack channel for updates.
   /
   / Just 3 steps:
   /   - Prepare: Replace all YOUR_GITHUB_ID and YOUR_PLAYER_NAME.
   /   - Code: Code your logic where identified below.
   /   - Submit: Submit by the deadline (Mon. July 27, 11 PM IST/1:30 PM EDT), updated to the latest template.
   /
   /
   / Your circuit should drive the following signals:
   /   /pairing[2:0]
   /      $score[15:0]: Score for each of the 3 possible dice pairings (higher score = better).
   /                    The pairing with the highest score is chosen.
   /      $priority_pair[0:0]: Which pair (0 or 1) gets priority if only one can start building.
   /   $end_turn: Assert to voluntarily end your turn and bank progress.
   /
   / Based on the following inputs (accessible within /_me scope, e.g. /_me$my_turn):
   /   $my_turn: Asserted when it's your turn.
   /   $rolls_this_turn[7:0]: Number of rolls taken this turn (valid when $my_turn).
   /   $num_players[2:0]: Number of players in the game (2-5).
   /   $my_player_index: This player's index (0-4).
   /   $current_player: Index of current player (whose turn it is).
   /   /pairing[2:0] -- 3 possible pairings of the dice
   /      /pair[1:0] -- 2 pairs per pairing
   /         /die[1:0] -- 2 dice per pair
   /            $value[2:0]: Die value (1-6)
   /         $sum[3:0]: Sum of the pair (determines tower)
   /         // Properties of the $sum tower (that this pair would build):
   /         $start_floor[3:0]: Your locked-in floor for this tower at turn start.
   /         $climb_floor[3:0]: Current climb floor for this tower during turn.
   /         $tower_height[3:0]: Goal floor to claim this tower.
   /   /tower[12:2] -- Your tower state (valid when $my_turn)
   /      $tower_height[3:0]: Goal floor to claim this tower.
   /      $turn_start_floor[3:0]: Your locked-in floor when turn started.
   /      $climb_floor[3:0]: Current floor during this turn (before ending turn).
   /      $climbing: Whether you've begun climbing this tower this turn.
   /      $claimed: Has any player claimed this tower? (blocks further building)
   /   $climbing_cnt[1:0]: Number of towers you're climbing this turn (max 3).
   /   $claimed_cnt[2:0]: Number of towers you've claimed so far.
   / And from the /_top scope (e.g. /_top/player[#player]/tower[2]$floor):
   /   /player[m5_PLAYER_MAX:0] -- All players' state ([#player] is yourself)
   /      /tower[12:2] -- Each tower's state for this player
   /         $max[3:0]: Max floor of this tower (same for all players).
   /         $floor[3:0]: Locked-in floor for this player.
   /         $claimed: Whether this player has claimed this tower.
