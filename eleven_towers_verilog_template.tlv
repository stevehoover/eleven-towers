   /
   / /------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
   / | The Second Annual Makerchip ASIC Design Showdown, Summer 2026, Eleven Towers |
   / \------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
   /
   / Find details in the repository README.md, and
   / register at https://www.redwoodeda.com/showdown-info.
   /
   / Each player modifies this template to provide their own custom player
   / control circuitry. This template is for players using Verilog. A TL-Verilog-based
   / template is provided separately. Monitor the Showdown Slack channel for updates.
   /
   / Just 3 steps:
   /   - Prepare: Replace all YOUR_GITHUB_ID and YOUR_PLAYER_NAME.
   /   - Code: Code your logic where identified below.
   /   - Submit: Submit by the deadline (Mon. July 27, 11 PM IST/1:30 PM EDT), updated to the latest template.
   /
   /
   / Module Interface:
   /
   / Your module receives the following inputs:
   /   clk, reset: Standard clock and reset signals
   /
   /   // === Game Context ===
   /   num_players[2:0]: Number of players in the game (2-5)
   /   my_player_index: This player's index (0-4)
   /   current_player: Index of current player (whose turn it is)
   /   my_turn: Asserted when it's your turn
   /   rolls_this_turn[7:0]: Number of rolls taken this turn (valid when my_turn)
   /
   /   // === Your Tower State ===
   /   tower_start_floor[12:2][3:0]: Your locked-in floor on each tower
   /   tower_climb_floor[12:2][3:0]: Your current turn floor on each tower (valid when my_turn)
   /   tower_height[12:2][3:0]: Goal height to claim each tower
   /   turn_start_tower_floor[12:2][3:0]: Your floor on each tower when this turn started
   /   tower_climbing[12:2]: Whether you've begun climbing this tower this turn
   /   tower_claimed[12:2]: Has any player claimed this tower?
   /   climbing_cnt[1:0]: Number of towers you're currently climbing (max 3)
   /   claimed_cnt[2:0]: Number of towers you've claimed so far
   /
   /   // === Pairing Options ===
   /   pairing_sum[2:0][1:0][3:0]: Sum of dice for each pairing's pairs
   /
   / Your module must provide the following outputs:
   /   pairing_score[2:0][15:0]: Score for each of 3 pairings (higher is better)
   /   priority_pair[2:0][0:0]: Which pair (0 or 1) gets priority for each pairing
   /   end_turn: Assert to end turn voluntarily
   /
   / Notes:
   /   - Towers are indexed [12:2] representing sums 2 through 12
   /   - Pairings are indexed [2:0] representing the 3 ways to pair 4 dice
   /   - Each pairing has 2 pairs [1:0], each containing 2 dice
   /   - Outputs should be combinational; highest score pairing is chosen
   /   - If my_turn is not asserted, outputs are ignored
   /
   / See also the game parameters and interface documentation in `eleven_towers_lib.tlv`.
